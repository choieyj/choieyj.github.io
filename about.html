    <h1>About TuneTrail</h1>
    <p>TuneTrail is a web application designed to connect music lovers with live experiences by helping users discover upcoming concerts from their top Spotify artists. This project uses the Spotify API to fetch a user's top artists and the Ticketmaster API to retrieve concert information for those artists.
    </p>

    <p>Each artist's concert data is presented in an easy-to-navigate table, sorted chronologically, and includes direct links to Ticketmaster event pages. The intuitive interface allows users to quickly find relevant live music events based on their listening habits.
    </p>

    <p>This project was developed by Eugene Choi and Richard Zhou as the final assignment for INST377, a course focused on full-stack web development and data integration. TuneTrail reflects our combined interests in web technology, user-centered design, and music accessibility.
